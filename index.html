            <p><h2>Bio</h2><br>My name is Page Bennett. I am a senior here at St. Thomas(big surprise) pursuing a CISC degree. I currently work at the OSF Music & Media collections, where we have thousands of DVDs and CDs available to check out, as well as streaming databases containing 10s of thousands films, all free for students to use. Outside of class, I like to play video games, bake, and watch films from the Music & Media Collections.</p>
            <p><h2>Technologies Used</h2><br>This entire site was built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No external libraries or packages were used. All of the styling is done in pure CSS, and JavaScript was employed to add dynamic functionality.</p>
